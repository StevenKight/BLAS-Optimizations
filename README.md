# Neural-Net-Optimizations
Testing optimizations to Neural Networks and the math needed for them.

## Optimizations

### Languages

#### C++
Testing the speed of C++ and its advantages of being a compiled language and having more control over memory and hardware.

#### Python
Testing the speed of Python and its advantages of being a interpreted language and having more control over the code.

#### Potential Other Languages
- Matlab
